# Discord Chill

A  bot template for [discord.js](http://discord.js.org/).

### Getting Started

First, edit the `config.js` file and fill out `OWNERID`, `PREFIX`, and `TOKEN`. 

The `OWNERID` variable should be set to your Discord ID, which you can obtain by enabling developer mode (found in the "apperance" tab in settings), right clicking your name in the online list of any server, and then clicking "Copy ID".

The `PREFIX` variable is used to tell the bot what prefix your commands should use. Most bots use `!`.

The `TOKEN` variable is your Discord bot's token. You can get this from the Discord Developer Portal.

### NPM Install

First Step: `NPM INSTALL DISCORD.JS`

Second Step: `NPM INSTALL FS`

Third Step: `NODE BOT`
